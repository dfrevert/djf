<h1>NXT-G MyBlocks and SaveAs</h1>
<p>By Doug Frevert</p>
<p><i>Another year and another NXT-G class.  This year exposed a bug in creating a MyBlock by SaveAs of another MyBlock.</i></p>
<hr /> 
<h2>SaveAs: don't use it to create a new MyBlock.</h2>
<h3>Don't:</h3>
<ol><li>Open an existing MyBlock.</li>
    <li>File -&gt; SaveAs -&gt; Enter a new name for the MyBlock.</li>
    <li>Edit the MyBlock with the new name.  Change something obvious.</li>
    <li>Close the MyBlock with the new name.<li>
    <li>Use the original and new MyBlock in a NXT-G program.</li>
    <li>Run the NXT-G program.  You may or may not see anything.</li>
    <li>Now open either of the MyBlocks and change something else.  The something else becomes part of both MyBlocks; the one edited and the one not edited. The "SaveAs" MyBlocks are linked together and that linkage is hidden.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Instead:</h3>
<ol><li>Create a NXT-G program that functions.</li>
    <li>Save</li>
    <li>Create a MyBlock from the NXT-G program.  This is the normal process.</li>
    <li>Save the MyBlock</li>
    <li>Close the MyBlock</li>
    <li>Close the NXT-G program without saving.</li>
    <li>Re-open the NXT-G program.</li>
    <li>Edit and then create second MyBlock.  The two MyBlocks will not be linked in mysterious ways.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Teachers often learn while teaching.</h3>
<p>Too bad about no one signing up for "advanced" NXT-G programming. Then again, I'm still learning the simple things.</p>
