  <h1>Friday Night</h1>

  <p><img src="mvc-634f.jpg" /><br />
  Steve reads Programming 101.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-635f.jpg" /><br />
  Tarek, Jack, and Sean communicate with Gusev Base.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-636f.jpg" /><br />
  Michael ponders the universe.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-638f.jpg" /><br />
  Amelia and Lisa check systems and "Roger that."</p>

  <h1>Saturday Afternoon</h1>

  <p><img src="mvc-639f.jpg" /><br />
  Sean and Jack prepare for the first head to head.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-640f.jpg" /><br />
  S.A.M.S. waits for round two.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-641f.jpg" /><br />
  Tarek and Michael prep their teammates. Coaches Steve and Leslie
  are within earshot.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-642f.jpg" /><br />
  Amelia and Lisa (the blur) set up.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-643f.jpg" /><br />
  The ice cores return to base.</p>

  <p>Not pictured: the crisis that immediately followed as the
  robot decided to spin in circles instead of driving straight down
  the ramp. 20 seconds of panic!!!</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-644f.jpg" /><br />
  Into the crater mission begins. As you can see, the crisis has
  been resolved. The ramp is down, the dust is cleared, the housing
  is in place, and the launcher released.</p>

  <p>Not pictured: the crater mission hung in the balance as the
  robot hung on the edge of the crater. Not quite in. 5..4..3.. The
  wheels caught and the robot teetered in. A jump for joy and a
  cheer rang out.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-645f.jpg" /><br />
  Back to the practice table to figure out why the robot couldn't
  climb into the crater -- well, almost couldn't.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-646f.jpg" /><br />
  Tarek and Michael prepare for the final round. The two teams
  scored 246 and 244 in the previous round. It should be a close
  match. The teams have compared notes. They do exactly the same
  missions.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-647f.jpg" /><br />
  In a blur, the robot is repositioned as Tarek and Michael
  complete every mission they attempt. Across the table --
  disaster. Their brick has fallen off the robot.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-648f.jpg" /><br />
