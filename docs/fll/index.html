<h1>Mindstorms NXT 2.0</h1>
<p>A flyer in today's (6/27/2009) mail included a description of <a href="http://shop.lego.com/product/?p=8547&LangId=2057&ShipTo=US">Lego's Mindstorms NXT 2.0</a> kit. It includes a color sensor <img src="RGB_ColorSensor_NXT20.jpg"> that is labeled RGB.  The old kit had a light sensor, that really was seeing infra-red.  Should be interesting.  It looks like it either has three lamps or three detectors.  Don't expect that it will be a leg up this FLL season.  Expect it will be just short of required in 2010. </p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.thenxtstep.blogspot.com/">nxtblogspot</a> had more information on the NXT 2.0 Color Sensor.</p>

<i>
<ul><li>It can be used in Color Sensor Mode. Using the standard software, it can detect six colors: black, white, red, green, blue and yellow</li>
    <li>It can be used in Lamp mode: It is possible to control the colored LED on the sensor, by setting it to either green, red or blue. In this mode, the light intensity would be just around the same brightness of the old Light Sensor.</li>
    <li>It can be used in Light Sensor Mode. In this mode, it acts just like the old light sensor: it returns a value from 0-100 where 0 is darkest, and 100 is brightest. In this mode, it is also possible to pick a desired LED color (again, red, blue or green).</li>
