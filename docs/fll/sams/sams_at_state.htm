  <h2>Friday Night</h2>

  <p><img src="mvc-673f.jpg" /><br />
  Michael changes the batteries.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-674f.jpg" /><br />
  Sean helps?</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-675f.jpg" /><br />
  Leslie waits for the team's attention.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-677f.jpg" /><br />
  Jack shows Tarek the effects of an explosion on Mars.
  <!-- <P><img src="mvc-678f.jpg"><br> --></p>

  <p><img src="mvc-679f.jpg" /><br />
  Amelia waits for her cue to read. The robot "Fido" sits
  awaiting rescue. Behind Amelia is the team's practice table,
  which leans against the front windows.</p>

  "Can you give us an external temperature reading?" Tarek and Jack
  practice SAMS' presentation of the Rover Rescue Mission.</p>

  <p><a href="mvc-682w.mpg"><img src="mvc-682w.jpg" alt=

  Jack "woop-woop"s. Amelia and Leslie (reading for Lisa) read
  lines from inside the "Lassie" rover. A living room is a great
  place for practicing.</p>
  <hr />

  <h2>Saturday</h2>

  <p><img src="mvc-683f.jpg" /><br />
  8:10 am. The team practices, 20 minutes before the Technical
  Judging.</p>

  <p><a href="mvc-684w.mpg"><img src="mvc-684w.jpg" alt=
  "1.0 Mb MPEG movie" /></a> (1.0 Mb)<br />
  A passing team says, "Way Cool!" as the SAMS team practices
  adding housing modules in a V.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-685f.jpg" /><br />
  Division 2, Group B Technical Judging begins with a description
  of the ground rules.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-686f.jpg" /><br />
  SAMS shows off the first mission: retrieve 3 ice cores from the
  crater. Success!</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-687f.jpg" /><br />
  SAMS prepares to move the rover off the sand dune. Missions to
  drop the gate, clear dust off the solar panel, launch the red
  ball, and add two habitation modules have already been run.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-688f.jpg" /><br />
  Jack, Amelia, and Lisa describe their programs to the judge.
  <!-- <P><img src="mvc-689f.jpg"><br> --></p>

  <p><img src="mvc-690f.jpg" /><br />
  Meanwhile, Sean, Tarek, and Michael (not shown here) describe
  their robot for the Robust and Innovative judges.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-691f.jpg" /><br />
  His judging form almost complete, the judge asks another
  question.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-692f.jpg" /><br />
  9:14 am. Amelia and Lisa in Space Camp jump suits prepare to
  enter the "Lassie" robot retriever. This is the Research,
  Presentation, and Teamwork judging.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-693f.jpg" /><br />
  10:10 am. First run at the competition tables. A microphone
  overload causes Jack and Michael to cover their ears. Their robot
  is ready to run.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-694f.jpg" /><br />
  Fred Rose (Mr. hightechkids.org) watches the team. He expects
  great things from the SAMS team that placed first in the first
  regional event of the year.<br />
  <br />
  Unfortunately a minor difference in the positioning of the
  table's red and black mat causes the robot's arm and hook to tip
  over the ice cores. Michael sees it, Jack doesn't. Jack's busy
  putting together the housing modules. Everything else goes
  perfectly. The team's score of 290 puts them into first place.
  <!-- <P><img src="mvc-695f.jpg"><br> --></p>

  <p><img src="mvc-696f.jpg" /><br />
  10:35 am. The team settles in for a long day, their hectic
  morning almost over. Sean, Jack, Amelia, and Lisa work on the
  "Save the Rover" mission.</p>

  <p><a href="mvc-697w.mpg"><img src="mvc-697w.jpg" alt=
  "1.1 Mb MPEG movie" /></a> (1.1 Mb)<br />
  Jack and Sean play with the "Lassie" landing portion of their
  presentation. The halls are getting crowded. A team from Hale
  School interrupts.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-698f.jpg" /><br />
  11:35 am. Amelia and Tarek set up for run #2 at the competition
  tables. The team is no longer in first place.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-699f.jpg" /><br />
  Laurie, Lisa, Sean, Jack and (behind Jack) Michael relax before
  the run starts.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-700f.jpg" /><br />
  11:36 am. The round starts and this time the robot collects the
  ice cores, but the referee claims they don't count because the
  arm is too high??? After a bit of discussion, the head ref
  resolves the dispute.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-701f.jpg" /><br />
  The gate is dropped, the dust cleared. Now, Amelia tries to get
  the ball to drop into the MAV Launcher. In the furor, they've
  inverted the position of the arm that holds the red ball. It
  fails repeatedly. They leave the table disappointed, but laughing
  about it. <!-- <P><img src="mvc-703f.jpg"><br> --></p>

  <p><img src="mvc-704f.jpg" /><br />
  12:30 pm. The extended lunch continues. Tarek, Lisa, Jack and
  Amelia discuss important topics like "Linkin Park."</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-705f.jpg" /><br />
  Michael decides to change the batteries after testing the voltage
  and getting a reading of less than 8.4 volts.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-706f.jpg" /><br />
  Michael and Tarek refuse to listen to the sage advice of their
  coaches.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-707f.jpg" /><br />
  Michael says, "What's firmware?"</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-708f.jpg" /><br />
  Michael maintains his vigil over the downloading firmware. The
  count goes from 0 to 2450. It takes more than five minutes.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-709f.jpg" /><br />
  After twenty minutes of trying to download firmware, they give
  up. The team substitutes another RCX with preloaded firmware.
  They load all five program slots with the latest programs. Less
  than five minutes until their third and final round at the
  competition tables.</p>

  <p><a href="mvc-710w.mpg"><img src="mvc-710w.jpg" alt=
  "0.7 Mb MPEG movie" /></a> (0.7 Mb)<br />
  1:55 pm. The roar of the competition area contrasts with the calm
  demeanor of Michael and Tarek. Michael runs the ice core mission
  while Tarek snaps the housing modules together for the fourth
  mission. Note that one ice core is left in the crater. Oh well!
  (0.8 Mb)</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-711f.jpg" /><br />
  Michael and Tarek struggle to load the housing modules onto the
  robot's arm using rubber bands. Note that the MAV Launcher has
  been released (a systems test), but the red ball is still in the
  launcher. Whoops! The good news: the robot lowered the gate and
  cleared the dust.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-712f.jpg" /><br />
  The robot has dropped the housing modules, but the magnets
  haven't locked. They send the robot back out to retrieve the
  housing modules.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-713f.jpg" /><br />
  They reload the housing modules and send the robot out a third
  time. It drops into place perfectly, but the magnets face the
  wrong way. Yikes!!! They switch to the "Into the crater" mode,
  foregoing the "Save the Rover" mission. Quick
  decision-making.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-714f.jpg" /><br />
  2:00 pm. Sean and Lisa watch for the robot to cross the line into
  the base after completing the "Sweep the Solar Panel" mission.
  This fourth run goes smoothly. For judging the team standings,
  the first score of the day (290) is their best. They get a 4th of
  35 seeding for the upcoming Head to Head competition.</p>
  <hr />
  Not pictured: The team places first in Group B for their
  "Research Presentation". They perform their skit at 2:35 pm. It
  goes very well. They have a 1 in 3 chance of taking home a
  trophy.
  <hr />

  <p><img src="mvc-715f.jpg" /><br />
  4:53 pm. They are in the last group to run their first
  head-to-head round. 34 Division 1 and 15 Division 2 teams have
  already been eliminated, when SAMS runs. Lisa and Michael run the
  robot.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-716f.jpg" /><br />
  Lisa and Michael run a great round. They break the 300
  barrier.</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-717f.jpg" /><br />
  5:11 pm. Round 2. Amelia and Michael. Everything works until the
  very last mission, "Rescue the Rover". The rover is off the sand
  dune, but the robot gets stuck and doesn't get into the crater.
  With twenty seconds left, Michael throws himself onto the table
  to grab the robot. Amelia places the 2x2 angle piece over the
  touch sensor; Michael switches to program slot #1 and presses the
  green "run" button. The robot crosses the table and leaps into
  the crater with just seconds to spare. Score 325, only 8 points
  short of the team's best possible score. (400 points are
  possible, but the team doesn't have time, programs, or the means
  to complete all the missions.)</p>

  <p><img src="mvc-718f.jpg" /><br />
  The teams jumps into the competition area to see if it really
  happened.</p>
  <hr />
  Not pictured: Round 3. The robot's wiring to the left side motor
  fails after completing the first mission. After a minute and a
  half of trouble-shooting, the wire lead is taken off, dust blown
  off and the robot works, but it is too late. For the first time
  ever, the robot scores less than a hundred points. The team on
  the other side of the table wins with a score of 202.

  <!-- <P><img src="mvc-720f.jpg"><br> -->

  <p><img src="mvc-721f.jpg" /><br />
  6:44 pm. The long day shows on the team's faces at the awards
  ceremony. SAMS wins no trophies, places 8th in the judged
  scoring, and has a thrilling day.</p>
