<H2>Mission Statement</H2>
<p>The Neighborhood Transportation Network
(NTN) is a grass roots, neighborhood-based organization
striving to bring social justice and
environmental responsibility to the provision
of transportation facilities in the Twin Cities
Metropolitan Area. Founded in 1988, NTN’s
focus has been the State of Minnesota’s proposed
$1 billion expansion of Interstate 35W,
which is already the largest highway in the
State. Our greater concern is the implementation
of a rational, integrated public transportation
system in the Twin Cities Metropolitan
Area.
